This was heavily influenced by the world of Lester Dent. However, I’ve added a few notes of my own. Here are some elements that make short stories unique:
They are more versatile, meaning you can experiment more, and don’t have to adhere to this template as much as I would recommend for longer works
They have a narrow focus, usually only focusing on one character and conflict
They revolve around a single choice or question, and the making of that choice counts as the character arc for the protagonist
They are brief. Every sentence counts.
## Chapter 1: The Choice
- Introduce the protagonist and put them in trouble immediately
- The antagonist is revealed (literally or figuratively)
- The protagonist tries to resolve the trouble
- Ends with an unexpected twist or mystery that complicates the plot and/or raises the stakes.
- The protagonist is struggling with a choice, one that is thematically or directly linked to the conflict. The decision they eventually make around this choice will eventually determine how the short story resolves itself.
## Chapter 2: The Trouble
- The protagonist makes progress but has a LOT of obstacles to overcome
- They try to solve the problems, but all attempts make the situation worse
- The protagonist is beaten physically or emotionally
- Ends with another complication, just when things didn’t seem like they could get any worse
## Chapter 3: The Twist
- There’s a surprising twist or revelation that changes the protagonist’s understanding of the conflict
- The protagonist tries once again to confront the antagonist and at first it seems like they’ve succeeded
- But the antagonist wins, and the protagonist falls right into their trap
- Ends with the protagonist’s worst moment so far
## Chapter 4: The Epiphany
- The protagonist makes a discovery, externally or internally that gives them an epiphany
- The Epiphany gives them clarity on the choice they’ve been debating
- Armed with this new clarity, they once again confront the antagonist and defeat them
- Wraps up any final narrative threads
- Ends with a powerful final image that presents a satisfying conclusion
